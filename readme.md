# Workshop 2: Electric Boogaloo

> Document examples of some mongo/express stuff are in /documented examples and the workshop with no added explainations resides in /document examples/Sarah's undocuement mongo workshop code/

> The basic file structure for the framework places all the ejs views (the HTML essentially) in the views folder, the partial components to be used in other pages go in /views/partial.

> public is where all JS CSS and image files go

> routes is where all the routers go, these guys are used when the server gets a request from the browser, the first guy I have set up is currently get all /URL urls from request and is called index.js, users.js gets /users/URL requests (and I haven't actually used it for anything).

> App has a lot of the core funtionality, the rest residing in the bin folder

> Server can be launched by typing npm start to execute the start command in the package, I've set up nodemon already and modified the start command accordingly.
