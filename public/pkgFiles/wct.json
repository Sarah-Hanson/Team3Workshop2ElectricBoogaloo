	"blurb": "The West Coast Trail (WCT) is an iconic backcountry, multi-day backpacking trail that is a bucket list challenge for many hikers. It is an experience that can bring even the most experienced hikers to their knees. Those who are well prepared physically, mentally, and equipment-wise, come away with tales of grit. Hikers climb more than 100 ladders with a heavy pack, trudge through deep mud, wade through mountain-fed rivers in fast-flowing hip-deep waters, and push through whatever weather the wild West Coast delivers â€” often driving wind and rain.",
	"details": "Seven days of supplies, trail and campsite bookings covered. Travel with one day hotel in Victoria before and after the hike included. Mandatory Trail orientation must be attended before setting out for the hike.",
